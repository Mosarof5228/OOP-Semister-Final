/*
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model that organizes software design around objects, which have attributes (data) and behavior (methods). It focuses on manipulating objects rather than just logic. OOP is ideal for large, complex, and maintainable software, promoting code reusability, scalability, and efficiency. It also supports collaborative development by dividing projects into manageable parts.
